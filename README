##### Files #####

- originalVWD.c: Implementation of the Vishkin's original algorithm to current hierarchical-memory SMP systems.
- depthfirstVWD.c: Our novel implementation of the Vishkin algorithm.
- types.h: Setting variables, constants and data types definitions.
- wool.c and wool.h: Wool code, an instance of the dynamic multithreading model.


##### Results #####

- images: Contain image files with results of our experiments.


##### Testing #####

- build.sh: Builds executable files of the originalVWD algorithm and depthfirstVWD algorithm.
- run_experiments.sh: Testing algorithms originalVWD and depthfirstVWD.
- dna.64MB: text of DNA.
- english.64MB: text of English.
- test_dna: Patterns to search in the text of DNA.
- test_english: Patterns to search in the text of English.


	To run experiments, you must to follow the following instructions:

	- First, execute "./build.sh"
	- and then "./run_experiments.sh test_dna 40 originalVWD depthfirstVWD" (using DNA patterns and maximum of 40 threads)
